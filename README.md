MatrixJS
========

Simple JS library to compute some of the basic matrix functions:

- Scalar matrix multiplication
```javascript
sxm(scalar,matrix)
```

- Matrix vector multiplication
```javascript
matrixVector(m,v)
```

- Matrix matrix multiplication
```javascript
mxm(m,m2)
```

- Transpose a  matrix
```javascript
transpose(m)
```

-  Sub-matrix
```javascript
subMatrix(m,i,j)
```

- Determinant of a matrix
```javascript
determinant(m)
```

- Matrix adjugate
```javascript
adjugate(m)
```

- Matrix inverse
```javascript
inverse(m)
```
